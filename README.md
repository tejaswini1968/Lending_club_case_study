# Loan Risk Assessment and Default Prediction: An Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
> The project aims to explore the factors that influence loan risk and default in a consumer finance company. It involves conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on past loan applicants' data to understand the patterns and attributes associated with loan defaults.
> 
> Two types of risks are considered in this analysis:
Risk of Not Approving a Repayable Loan: If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, not approving it results in a business loss.
Risk of Default: If the applicant is likely to default, approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.

## General Information
- Analysis: EDA to understand the influence of consumer attributes and loan attributes on loan default tendencies.
- Business problem: Whether to approve loan application, reduce loan amount, or lend at a higher or lower interest rate.
- Dataset: Past loan applicants' data.

## Objectives:
- Identify patterns and associations between applicant attributes and loan defaults.
- Aid in making informed decisions on loan approvals, loan amounts, and interest rates.
- Minimize financial losses by reducing loan defaults.

## Methods:
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
- Categorical Variable Analysis: Identifying categorical attributes influencing loan defaults.
- Numerical Variable Analysis: Exploring numerical attributes' impact on loan risk.
- Visualizations: Utilizing data visualizations, including bar plots, box plots, and heatmaps, to gain insights.
- Default Rate Analysis: Calculating and visualizing default rates.
- Risk Assessment: Determining the risk associated with each variable and their combinations.

## Conclusions
- Univariate analysis provided a deeper understanding of the dataset, highlighting the distribution of numerical and categorical variables.
- Categorical variable analysis showed varying default rates based on factors such as loan term, grade, purpose, and verification status and variables like grade and sub-grades affected default rates the most. 
- Numerical variables like annual income, loan amount, and interest rate were examined for their correlation with loan status and higher loan amount and interest rate showed higher default rates. 
- ata transformation unveiled the potential influence of non-linear relationships and highlighted some weak to medium correlations.
- Higher interest rates showed higher default rates across all board. 

The Loan Risk Assessment and Default Prediction project through EDA will provide valuable insights into mitigating financial losses associated with loan defaults. By analyzing past loan applicants' data, the company can make informed decisions and reduce risks while serving their customers effectively.
